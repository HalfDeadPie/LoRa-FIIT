<dl class="section user"><dt>Overview</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>RadioHead consists of 2 main sets of classes: Drivers and Managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drivers provide low level access to a range of different packet radios and other packetized message transports.</li>
<li>Managers provide high level message sending and receiving facilities for a range of different requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every RadioHead program will have an instance of a Driver to provide access to the data radio or transport, and a Manager that uses that driver to send and receive messages for the application. The programmer is required to instantiate a Driver and a Manager, and to initialise the Manager. Thereafter the facilities of the Manager can be used to send and receive messages.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a Driver on its own, without a Manager, although this only allows unaddressed, unreliable transport via the Driver's facilities.</p>
<p>In some specialised use cases, it is possible to instantiate more than one Driver and more than one Manager.</p>
<p>A range of different common embedded microprocessor platforms are supported, allowing your project to run on your choice of processor.</p>
<p>Example programs are included to show the main modes of use.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Drivers</dt><dd></dd></dl>

<p>Other platforms are partially supported, such as Generic AVR 8 bit processors, MSP430. We welcome contributions that will expand the range of supported platforms.</p>
<p>RadioHead is available (through the efforts of others) for PlatformIO. PlatformIO is a cross-platform code builder and the missing library manager. <a href="http://platformio.org/#!/lib/show/124/RadioHead">http://platformio.org/#!/lib/show/124/RadioHead</a></p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>History</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>RadioHead was created in April 2014, substantially based on code from some of our other earlier Radio libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>RHMesh, RHRouter, RHReliableDatagram and RHDatagram are derived from the RF22 library version 1.39.</li>
<li>RH_RF22 is derived from the RF22 library version 1.39.</li>
<li>RH_RF69 is derived from the RF69 library version 1.2.</li>
<li>RH_ASK is based on the VirtualWire library version 1.26, after significant conversion to C++.</li>
<li>RH_Serial was new.</li>
<li>RH_NRF24 is based on the NRF24 library version 1.12, with some significant changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this combination and redevelopment, we have tried to retain all the processor dependencies and support from the libraries that were contributed by other people. However not all platforms can be tested by us, so if you find that support from some platform has not been successfully migrated, please feel free to fix it and send us a patch.</p>
<p>Users of RHMesh, RHRouter, RHReliableDatagram and RHDatagram in the previous RF22 library will find that their existing code will run mostly without modification. See the RH_RF22 documentation for more details.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Installation</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries sub-folder of your sketchbook. The example sketches will be visible in in your Arduino, mpide, maple-ide or whatever. <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries">http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries</a></p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Building for Particle Photon</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>The Photon is not supported by the Arduino IDE, so it takes a little effort to set up a build environment. Heres what we did to enable building of RadioHead example sketches on Linux, but there are other ways to skin this cat.

 NRF905 examples were missing </dd>
<dd>
1.7 2014-05-03<br  />
 Added support for Arduino Due. Tested with RH_NRF905, RH_Serial, RH_ASK. IMPORTANT CHANGE to interrupt pins on Arduino with RH_RF22 and RH_RF69 constructors: previously, you had to specify the interrupt <em>number</em> not the interrupt <em>pin</em>. Arduinos and Uno32 are now consistent with all other platforms: you must specify the interrupt pin number. Default changed to pin 2 (a common choice with RF22 shields). Removed examples/maple/maple_rf22_reliable_datagram_client and examples/maple/maple_rf22_reliable_datagram_client since the rf22 examples now work out of the box with Flymaple. Removed examples/uno32/uno32_rf22_reliable_datagram_client and examples/uno32/uno32_rf22_reliable_datagram_client since the rf22 examples now work out of the box with ChipKit Uno32. </dd>

 Added support for YIELD in Teensy 2 and 3, suggested by Steve Childress.<br  />
 Documentation updates. Clarify use of headers and Flags<br  />
 Fixed misalignment in RH_RF69 between ModemConfigChoice definitions and the implemented choices which meant you didnt get the choice you thought and GFSK_Rb55555Fd50 hung the transmitter.<br  />
 Preliminary work on Linux simulator. </dd>
<dd>
1.9 2014-05-14 <br  />
 Added support for using Timer 2 instead of Timer 1 on Arduino in RH_ASK when RH_ASK_ARDUINO_USE_TIMER2 is defined. With the kind assistance of Luc Small. Thanks!<br  />

 Fixed RH_RF22 so that lastRssi() returns the signal strength in dBm. Suggested by Steve Childress.<br  />
 Added support for getLastPreambleTime() to RH_RF69. Requested by Steve Childress.<br  />
 RH_NRF24::init() now checks if there is a device connected and responding, else init() will fail. Suggested by Steve Brown.<br  />
 RHSoftwareSPI now initialises default values for SPI pins MOSI = 12, MISO = 11 and SCK = 13.<br  />
 Fixed some problems that prevented RH_NRF24 working with mixed software and hardware SPI on different devices: a race condition due to slow SPI transfers and fast acknowledgement.<br  />
 </dd>
<dd>
1.17 2014-06-02 <br  />
 Fixed a debug typo in RHReliableDatagram that was introduced in 1.16.<br  />
 RH_NRF24 now sets default power, data rate and channel in init(), in case another app has previously set different values without powerdown.<br  />

 Added sample sketches nrf51_audio_tx and nrf51_audio_rx which show how to build an audio TX/RX pair with RedBear nRF51822 boards and a SparkFun MCP4725 DAC board. Uses the built-in ADC of the nRF51822 to sample audio at 5kHz and transmit packets to the receiver which plays them via the DAC.<br  />
 </dd>
<dd>
1.47 2015-09-18 Removed top level Makefile from distribution: its only used by the developer and its presence confuses some people.<br  />
 Fixed a problem with RHReliableDatagram with some versions of Raspberry Pi random() that causes problems: random(min, max) sometimes exceeds its max limit. </dd>

1.49 2015-10-01 Fixed problems that prevented interrupts working correctly on Arduino Zero and Due. Builds and runs with 1.6.5 (with 'Arduino SAMD Boards' for Zero version 1.6.1) from arduino.cc. Arduino version 1.7.7 from arduino.org is not currently supported. </dd>
<dd>
1.50 2015-10-25 Verified correct building and operation with Arduino 1.7.7 from arduino.org. Caution: You must burn the bootloader from 1.7.7 to the Arduino Zero before it will work with Arduino 1.7.7 from arduino.org. Conversely, you must burn the bootloader from 1.6.5 to the Arduino Zero before it will work with Arduino 1.6.5 from arduino.cc. Sigh.

 </dd>
<dd>
1.65 2017-01-11 Fixed a race condition with RH_NRF51 that prevented ACKs being reliably received.<br  />
 Removed code in RH_NRF51 that enabled the DC-DC converter. This seems not to be a necessary condition for the radio to work and is now left to the application if that is required.<br  />
 Proven interoperation between nRF51822 and nRF52832.<br  />
 Modification and testing of RH_NRF51 so it works with nRF52 family processors, such Sparkfun nRF52832 breakout board, with Arduino 1.6.13 and Sparkfun nRF52 boards manager 0.2.3 using the procedures outlined in <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52832-breakout-board-hookup-guide">https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52832-breakout-board-hookup-guide</a><br  />
 Caution, the Sparkfun development system for Arduino is still immature. We had to rebuild the nrfutil program since the supplied one was not suitable for the Linux host we were developing on. See <a href="https://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=45071">https://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=45071</a> Also, after downloading a sketch in the nRF52832, the program does not start executing cleanly: you have to reset the processor again by pressing the reset button. This appears to be a problem with nrfutil, rather than a bug in RadioHead. </dd>

1.66 2017-01-15 Fixed some errors in (unused) register definitions in <a class="el" href="RH__RF95_8h_source.html">RH_RF95.h</a>.<br  />
 Fixed a problem that caused compilation errors in RH_NRF51 if the appropriate board support was not installed. </dd>
<dd>
1.67 2017-01-24 Added <a class="el" href="classRH__RF95.html#a96154a00662d73f69b9858597c8d4c9b">RH_RF95::frequencyError()</a> to return the estimated centre frequency offset in Hz of the last received message </dd>
<dd>
1.68 2017-01-25 Fixed arithmetic error in <a class="el" href="classRH__RF95.html#a96154a00662d73f69b9858597c8d4c9b">RH_RF95::frequencyError()</a> for some platforms. </dd>
<dd>
1.69 2017-02-02 Added <a class="el" href="classRH__RF95.html#a13efb0779e4bc522986f272201cb43cf">RH_RF95::lastSNR()</a> and improved lastRssi() calculations per the manual. </dd>
<dd>
1.70 2017-02-03 Added link to Binpress commercial license purchasing. </dd>
<dd>
1.71 2017-02-07 Improved support for STM32. Patch from Bent Guldbjerg Christensen. </dd>
<dd>
1.72 2017-03-02 In RH_RF24, fixed a problem where some important properties were not set by the ModemConfig. Added properties 2007, 2008, 2009. Also properties 200a was not being set in the chip. Reported by Shannon Bailey and Alan Adamson. Fixed corresponding convert.pl and added it to the distribution. </dd>
<dd>
1.73 2017-03-04 Significant changes to RH_RF24 and its API. It is no longer possible to change the modulation scheme programatically: it proved impossible to cater for all the possible crystal frequencies, base frequency and modulation schemes. Instead you can use one of a small set of supplied radio configuration header files, or generate your own with Silicon Labs WDS application. Changing modulation scheme required editing RH_RF24.cpp to specify the appropriate header and recompiling. convert.pl is now redundant and removed from the distribution. </dd>
<dd>
1.74 2017-03-08 Changed RHReliableDatagram so it would not ACK messages heard addressed to other nodes in promiscuous mode.<br  />
 Added RH_RF24::deviceType() to return the integer value of the connected device.<br  />
 Added documentation about how to connect RFM69 to an ESP8266. Tested OK.<br  />
 RH_RF24 was not correctly changing state in sleep() and setModeIdle().<br  />
 Added example rf24_lowpower_client.pde showing how to put an arduino and radio into a low power mode between transmissions to save battery power.<br  />
 Improvements to RH_RF69::setTxPower so it now takes an optional ishighpowermodule flag to indicate if the connected module is a high power RFM69HW, and so set the power level correctly. Based on code contributed by bob.</dd></dl>
